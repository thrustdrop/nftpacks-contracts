# NFT Packs: contracts

NFT Packs is a tool for NFT giveaways. Bundle [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFTs as rewards into
packs and airdrop them to an audience.

On opening a pack, the opener will receive either one of the reward NFTs or
an [ERC 1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) for participating in the giveaway.

NFT Packs is powered by [$PACK Protocol](https://nkrishang.gitbook.io/pack-protocol/).

### Quick Example
You have 100 ERC 721 NFTs you want to giveaway.

You bundle those 100 NFTs into a total of 1000 packs and airdrop them
to an audience.

10% of those packs i.e. 10 packs will yield a reward NFT on opening. The rest
will yield an ERC 1155 NFT as a proof of participating in the givaway.
